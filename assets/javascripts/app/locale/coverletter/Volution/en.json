    "Beginning":"I’ve noticed you have a position open for a UI developer. I’ve been looking for the opportunity to work with the latest single page application frameworks. I’ve been using one on my own projects and have been hard at work making a skeleton stack that has many capabilities useful for a wide range of development scenarios, all fitting together like a stack of tetris pieces waiting for the long one. I believe the long piece is you. I’ve been a consultant building applications for a number of companies the past year, and I’d like the opportunity to join a team and make something together that we can be proud of.",
    "Middle":"But enough about why I want to work for you. This site is an example of what I can do for you. It has been developed using the durandal/knockout client side stack, as well as zurb foundation for presentation using Sass. It has all the observable capabilities baked into every aspect of it, from dates, to input masks, and from localization (i18n) to formating. I’ve worked with all of these tools in my professional experiences as a consultant and I’ve found the best of the best. Integration of libraries is what I do best, and this stack of libraries showcase that ability, keeping separation of concerns, modularization, and working with the single page application way of developing software.",
    "End":"I hope that you enjoy the work I’ve put together, and heck, even if you don’t hire me, take a look at my Github and see if any of my work can be used in your stack. It’s all open source, this framework is installable using node and mimosa, and my other projects are on bower, npm and nuget. I look forward to hearing back from you, and check back on this site often, as it will be updated with all of my latest work on this framework."
